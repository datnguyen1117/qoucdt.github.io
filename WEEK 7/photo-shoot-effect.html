            <h1>PHOTOSHOOT EFFECT</h1>
            <p>In this tutorial, we are creating a photo shoot effect with our just-released PhotoShoot jQuery plug-in. With it you can convert a regular div on the page into a photo shooting stage simulating a camera-like feel.</p>
            <p>Potential clients want to see who they'll be working with. They want to hire people, not stock photography. We produced a custom photo shoot to bring the people of Paterson Buchanan front and center and to underscore the firm's open and welcoming style. Vivid images illustrate Paterson Bá»¥canan's wide range of clients, as well as their commitmeny to the picturesque region the firm serves.</p>
